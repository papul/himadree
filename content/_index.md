I am a Ph.D. student in the Centre for the Environment at Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Guwahati, India. 

Before joining IIT, I obtained undergraduate and postgraduate degree in Bioscience and Bioinformatics from Tezpur University, Assam in 2018. I joined IIT Guwahati in 2021 under the supervision of Dr. Lal Mohan Kundu. 

I am currently working on novel carbon-based Graphene oxide and chitosan-based conjugated polymeric nanocomposite for the effective adsorption of heavy metal ions in water resources. Environmental contamination has always been public concern, particularly water pollution. Wastewater treatment remains a critical issue globally till date despite various technological advancements and breakthroughs. Heavy metal in wastewater poses a great threat to human health if untreated properly, which makes its removal of utmost importance. Among various wastewater treatment techniques, adsorption is the most common technique to remove heavy metal in wastewater due to its flexible design, operation, and cost-effectiveness. 

Despite being a biotechnologist, I was very much interested to continue my research in novel materials that has a broad application in environmental remediation and biomedical applications. In May 2019, I was awarded the prestigious Prime Minister Research Fellowship. 

I wish to use my knowledge and skills to provide significant contribution to the society. I prefer to work hard in a challenging environment with purpose of growth, knowledge and creativity.
